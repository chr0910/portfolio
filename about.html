            <h1>My name is Chihiro.</h1>
            <p>I graduated with a Graduate Diploma in ICT at Ara Institute of Canterbury in 2021.</p>
            <p>I graduated with a Degree in Architecture and Environmental Design in Japan in 2012.</p>
            <p>While COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, I self-studied web design. I started with WordPress and quickly moved on to study HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript. I found myself very much enjoying to create and design websites from scratch. After that, I became willing to learn more about programming. Then I completed a programming course. This experience confirmed my passion for designing and creating web applications as well writing scripts and managing data.</p>
